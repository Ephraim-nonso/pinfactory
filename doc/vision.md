Rough draft.


Open source has unique advantages (Benkler) -- when developers can match their own skills and interests to software tasks, we get more software value for less investment in coordination and micromanagement.

But how do we pay for it?



## Old answer 1: Cognitive surplus

People like to build fun things and do creative work. When we have free time we occupy it with arts and crafts.

Some cultures and institutions can supply copious free time to some members.  If you have a job at Bell Labs, or are a student at a university in Finland, you have the freedom to allocate your development skills to solve interesting and important problems.

However, free time is not a reality for most people who are qualified to create value with software.



## Old answer 2: Complementary goods

Open source is the complement to many other products of value.  (See Joel Spolsky's "Strategy Letter V" and Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto).

A classic example is the company that pays developers to write and release Linux kernel drivers for its hardware.  The developers are valued members of the Linux kernel project and valued employees.

Open source development is also the "complement" to a developer's paid labor, when used as part of the "GitHub is the New Resume" effect.  And of course there's the "service and support" model, or the "paid hosting" model.

While complements are one way to keep open source development paid for, many situations in which software can create value are not a immediate
complement to something else.


## Bootstrapping new developers?

Where do we get the budget to train people to a skill level where they can contribute?

Look at other Future of Work ideas such as personal time currencies and income-share education?


## Increasing quality levels

Market failure: users want high quality, developers want to make high quality, markets incentivize low quality.

Opportunity for market design.


## New software financing model

Subscription-based systems, bounty systems, and now risk hedging systems?
